  <h1>About Me</h1>
  

  <hr/>

<p>I am new to the web developing world as I have started in January 2024.<br/>
  You are probably thinking it was a new years resolution but I have been thinking of doing this since late 2023.</p>
  
  <P>A bit about myself, I love learning new things constantly. That's why I am learning <br/>
  web development. With that strong drive for learning, I am absolutely addicted to the <br/>
martial art Brazillian Jiu Jitsu (picture of me after rolling at the bottom)</P>

<p>I am really excited to see how far I go with web development, This will be exciting <br/>
and interesting.</p>
